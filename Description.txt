I have accomplished this task in a class name Matrix. Matrix class has separate methods for both simple multiplication
and Strassen multiplication. Simple multiplication is done using method "multiply_Old(Matrix)" and Strassen is done using 
method "multiply_Strassen(Matrix A,Matrix B)"

For JUnit testing I used a class MatrixTest that contains tests for both the methods "multiply_Old(Matrix)" and "multiply_Strassen(Matrix A,Matrix B)"
